# Contributing to abagen

Welcome to the abagen repository!
We're excited you're here and want to contribute.

These guidelines are designed to make it as easy as possible to get involved.
If you have any questions that aren't discussed below, please let us know by opening an [issue][link_issues]!

Before you start you'll need to set up a free [GitHub][link_github] account and sign in.
Here are some [instructions][link_signupinstructions].

## Labels

    If you experience the same bug as one already listed, please add any additional information that you have as a comment.

## Making a change

We appreciate all contributions to abagen, but those accepted fastest will follow a workflow similar to the following:

**1. Comment on an existing issue or open a new issue referencing your addition.**

This allows other members of the abagen development team to confirm that you aren't overlapping with work that's currently underway and that everyone is on the same page with the goal of the work you're going to carry out.

[This blog][link_pushpullblog] is a nice explanation of why putting this work in up front is so useful to everyone involved.

**2. [Fork][link_fork] the [abagen repository][link_abagen] to your profile.**

This is now your own unique copy of abagen.
Changes here won't effect anyone else's work, so it's a safe space to explore edits to the code!

Make sure to [keep your fork up to date][link_updateupstreamwiki] with the master repository.

**3. Make the changes you've discussed.**

Try to keep the changes focused. If you feel tempted to "branch out" then please make a [new branch][link_branches].

**4. Submit a [pull request][link_pullrequest].**

A member of the development team will review your changes to confirm that they can be merged into the main codebase.

## Recognizing contributions

We welcome and recognize all contributions from documentation to testing to code development.
You can see a list of our current contributors in the [contributors tab][link_contributors].

## Thank you

You're awesome. :wave::smiley:
